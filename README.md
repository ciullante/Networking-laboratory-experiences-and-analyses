## Introduction
This repository contains detailed reports on experiments and analyses conducted as part of networking courses. The reports cover a range of topics, including IP Fragmentation, TCP and UDP behavior over a Linux Network, Video Streaming.

## Reports
1. [IP Fragmentation Analysis](./01_IP_Fragmentation.pdf): This report explores the analysis of IP Fragmentation, ping MTU discovery option, and Jumbo frames.

2. [Chargen Application Analysis](./02_Analysis_of_Chargen.pdf): An in-depth analysis of the Chargen application with the goal of gaining a deep understanding of the TCP protocol.

3. [Network Performance Analysis with 2.5Gb NIC](./03_Analysis_of_Performance_2.5Gb.pdf): This report delves into the analysis of network performance using a 2.5Gb NIC. The experiment involved Iperf3 and Nttcp, exploring different sets of offloading capabilities and jumbo frames.

4. [Impact of RTT and Packet Loss on Congestion Control Algorithms](./04_Impact_of_RTT_and_Packet_Loss.pdf): A detailed analysis of multiple congestion control algorithms and their behavior under different Round-Trip Time (RTT) and Packet Loss percentage scenarios.

5. [Video Streaming VLC Analysis](./05_Video_Streaming_VLC_analysis.pdf): This report investigates the analysis of VLC client/server streaming over different transport protocols and with different transcoding settings and packet loss percentage.

6. [Nmap Analysis](./06_Nmap_Analysis.pdf): An analysis of the Nmap application over a LAN, considering privileged and unprivileged modes, and experimenting with different port scanning algorithms.
